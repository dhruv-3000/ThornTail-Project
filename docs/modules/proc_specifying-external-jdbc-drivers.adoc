= Specifying external JDBC drivers

When executing an application, either as an uber JAR or using a hollow JAR, you can specify a JDBC driver JAR using the `thorntail.classpath` system property.
This way, you do not need to package the driver in the application.

The `thorntail.classpath` property accepts one or more paths to JAR files separated by `;` (a semicolon).
The specified JAR files are added to the classpath of the application.
