You can use this fraction to add a dependency on all fractions that implement the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications.

== Note about YAML configuration

Some Eclipse MicroProfile specifications define configuration properties that use `/` as a delimiter, because the `.` character is used in fully qualified class names.
When writing the YAML configuration, it is required to split around `.` and _not_ around `/`.

.YAML configuration for MicroProfile Rest Client
====
For example, MicroProfile Rest Client specifies that you can configure URL of an external service with a configuration property named `com.example.demo.client.Service/mp-rest/url`.
This translates to the following YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
com:
  example:
    demo:
      client:
        Service/mp-rest/url: http://localhost:8080/...
