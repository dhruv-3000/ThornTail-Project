= Hibernate

This fraction provides the same functionality as the `jpa` fraction.

Additionally, the `hibernate` fraction provides dependencies on the correct versions of Hibernate artifacts.
If you use Hibernate APIs in your applications, you can use this fraction to manage the Hibernate versions instead of managing them manually.
